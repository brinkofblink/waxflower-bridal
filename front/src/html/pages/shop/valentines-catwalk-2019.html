<p><small>The Wedding Wishing Well Foundation is a new organisation launched in 2012 with a single purpose - organising and funding weddings for terminally ill people. There are many men and women in the UK living with life limiting conditions or terminal illnesses who long to marry their special partner in life. The Wedding Wishing Well Foundation believe that few things in life can be more important or rewarding, than giving such a person a chance to have their dream wedding day, with all the excitement, love and happiness that brings. As they are fully aware that time can be precious, they are able to organise the arrangements against the clock where required. For many families, the memory of a happy wedding day can be a cherished moment. Surrounded by family and friends, enjoying each other’s company and being full of joy and laughter; a wedding day is an occasion where everyone can look back and remember that special event, and smile.</small></p>
