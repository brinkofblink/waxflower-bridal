            <h2>When should I start looking for my dress?</h2>
            <p>We would recommend to start looking 9-12 months in advance of your wedding date. Just to insure your descion
                making is relaxing and not rushed. We would recommend placing your order 8-10 months before your wedding
                date.

            <h2>Do I need to book an appointment?</h2>
            <p>Yes is the answer. As our appointments are private so each bride has the whole shop to herself for an hour. We
                want to ensure that the bride has our full commitment/attention and has the best experience EVER!</p>

            <h2>Do we charge for appointments?</h2>
            <p>We do not charge for our appointments between Tuesday- Saturday. For our Sunday appointments we take a £20 booking
                fee deposit at the time of booking, which is refundable as long as you come to your appointment. We also
                offer evening appointments too where there is also a £20 booking fee deposit at the time of booking. If you
                can not come to your appointment please give us 48 hours notice otherwise the booking fee deposit is non-refundable.</p>

            <h2>How much are the collections?</h2>
            <p>Our pieces start from £820- £3200. We wanted to insure that we could cater for every kind of bride to suit all
                budgets. Please have a look at the ‘Designer’ pages in order to give you a better understanding of the price
                ranges of each designer. Please note that alterations are not included in the price of the garement.</p>

            <h2>Our sample sizes</h2>
            <p>Our standard sample sizes are 12. We do also hold some 14’s too. All samples will never be the perfect fit. We
                will do our very best to fit the garment to your size, but you may need to use your imagination to envisage
                how the garment will fit once it has been made to your largest measurement.</p>

            <h2>What does made-to-order mean?</h2>
            <p>Made-to-order is when you have found ‘the one’ and have placed your order with Waxflower Bridal. This is when
                your garment making begins. Based on your measurements that we take, we order the closest numerical dress
                size. Please note that the garment will not be made to your exact measurements. This would be a made-to-measure.
                To achieve the perfect fit, our amazing seamstress will fit the garment to you.</p>

            <h2>What underwear shall I wear to the appointment?</h2>
            <p>We recommend nude underwear. It isn’t the sexiest type but the most practical for bridal styling. If you think
                you want to wear a strapless dress or a low cut dress then think about what bra to wear e.g. Strapless bra
                or stick on cups.</p>
            <p>We have shoes here but you’re more than welcome to bring your own to the appointment.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="wide">
            <h2>How many people can I bring to my appointment?</h2>
            <p>We suggest 3 guests as we’ve found that too many opinions can be conflicting and overwhelming for the bride.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Payment procedure</h2>
            <p>When placing your order we require 50% deposit, which is non-refundable, of the full amount of the garment. The
                balance is required at your first fitting which is usually around 2 months before your wedding date. You’ll
                then have 2-3 fittings with the seamstress. Please note that all sales are non-refundable, non-transferable
                and non-exchangeable, therefore final.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="wide">
            <h2>Please note:</h2>
            <p>We would really appreciate it if you do not wear heavy make-up foundations, fake tan and lipstick to your appointment
                or fittings as there is a very high risk of it coming off onto the garments. We can not be held responsible
                for any fake tan or make-up transferred to your actual garment. It would be your responsibility to remove
                the stains created by yourself.</p>
