            <h2>When should I start looking for my dress?</h2>
            <p>To ensure your decision making is relaxed and not rushed, we recommend you start lookibg 9-12 months before your wedding date. We recommend placing your made-to-order 8-10 months before your wedding date.

            <h2>Do I need to book an appointment?</h2>
            <p>Yes. This is because all our appointments are private so each bride has the whole shop to herself for an hour. We want to ensure that every bride has our full attention and has the best experience EVER!</p>

            <h2>Do we charge for appointments?</h2>
            <p>We do not charge for our appointments during our normal opening times (Tuesday - Saturday).
                If you would like a Sunday appointment, or an evening appointment, we are able to accommodate this for a £20 booking fee deposit. This fee is taken at the time of booking and is refundable as long as you come to your appointment.  If you
                can not come to your appointment please give us 48 hours notice otherwise the booking fee deposit will not be refunded.</p>

            <h2>How much are the collections?</h2>
            <p>We want to ensure that we can cater for every bride by suiting all budgets So our starting prices range from £820–£3200. Please have a look at the ‘Designer’ pages in order to give you a better understanding of the price
                ranges for each designer. Please note that alterations are not included in the price of the garment.</p>

            <h2>Our sample sizes</h2>
            <p>Our sample garments tend to be size 12, and we do hold some size 14 too. Samples are unlikely to be the perfect fit. We
                will do our very best to fit the garment to your size, but you may need to use your imagination to envisage
                how the garment will fit once you have the correct size.</p>

            <h2>What does made-to-order mean?</h2>
            <p>Made-to-order is when you have found ‘the one’ and have placed your order with Waxflower Bridal. This is when
                your garment making begins. Based on your measurements that we take, we order the closest numerical dress
                size. To achieve the perfect fit, our amazing seamstress will fit the garment to you. Please note that the garment will not be made to your exact measurements.

            <h2>What should I wear to the appointment?</h2>
            <p>We recommend you wear nude underwear as it's the most practical for bridal styling. If you think
                you want to wear a strapless or low-cut dress then think about what bra to wear e.g. strapless bra
                or stick-on cups.</p>
            <p>We have shoes here but you’re more than welcome to bring your own to the appointment.</p>
            <p>Please do not wear heavy makeup or fake tan to your appointment or fitting as there is a very high risk of it coming off on the garments. If you were to get any marks on the garments, ---------------------  </p>

        <li class="wide">
            <h2>How many people can I bring to my appointment?</h2>
            <p>We suggest up to 3 guests as we’ve found that too many opinions can be conflicting and overwhelming for the bride.</p>
        </li>

            <h2>Payment procedure</h2>
            <p>When placing your order we require non-refundable 50% deposit. The
                balance is required at your first fitting (which is usually around 2 months before your wedding date). Please note that all sales are final: non-refundable, non-transferable
                and non-exchangeable.</p>
