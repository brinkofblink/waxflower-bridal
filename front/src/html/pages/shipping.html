    <h1>Shipping</h1>
        <h2>PROCESSING TIME</h2>

        <h3>Hand Embroidered Patches, T-shirts and Sweatshirts:</h3>

        <p>All hand embroidered items are individually made to order especially for you. Once you place your order, it is placed in a queue and will be made as soon as possible. Turnaround time for all hand embroidered items is currently 2 weeks and for embellished items it is currently 4 weeks. If you have a special occasion and need an item sooner, email us (at info@waxflowerbridal.co.uk) before you place an order and we will try my best to accommodate you. Please note that it is more important to us that your embroidery is finished to the highest quality than rushed.</p>
