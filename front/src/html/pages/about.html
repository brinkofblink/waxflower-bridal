  <h2>So, a little bit about me...</h2>
  <p>I absolutely love everything bridal and fashion - especially when the two combine! I have been lucky enough to work in the luxury bridal industry for 10 years, including working for a British bridal accessories designer and becoming a senior stylist and manager of a well-known boutique in the UK. I have built a wealth of knowledge about the industry and these experiences have fuelled my passion to build my own business and create a boutique which encompasses what I feel every bride should experience. A welcoming and friendly boutique offering expert advice on shape and style... whilst having FUN!</p>

    <h2>The best of British design</h2>
    <p>I have always loved all things fashion. So much so that I studied footwear design at the prestigious London College of Fashion for 4 years (I am such a sucker for a good pair of shoes!). My studies taught me the importance of using quality materials and creating the perfect fit. When thinking about which designers to work with it was an easy decision. British all the way! It is a dream come true to be stocking such fabulous names. The importance of the perfect fit is something I truly believe in which is why I oversee all fittings with our experienced in-house seamstress, giving my brides the personal experience they deserve. </p>
    <p>I have a beautiful little girl called Hattie.  Opening my own luxury bridal boutique has been my dream for a long time and I want to show her that you can do anything you want in life that your heart desires. You only live once so you've got to make the most of it and follow your dreams! ❤ #girlboss</p>

  <div><h2>The Boutique</h2>
  <p>The best thing about my job is getting to know every one of my brides. I absolutely love the amazing and unique journey I go through with them. It is always a bonus to make life-long friends with my brides whilst doing a job I enjoy. I feel very privileged!</p>
  <p>Forget stuffy and exclusionary! Waxflower Bridal is a fun and relaxed haven for women to browse the very best of luxury British Bridalwear.</p>
  <p>Situated on a quaint cobbled street in Chepstow, South Wales, Waxflower Bridal is the only boutique in Wales to stock gowns from Jenny Packham, Suzanne Neville, Halfpenny London and La Poesie. This exclusively British collection also includes pieces from House of Ollichon, a completely dress-less bridal collection, making Waxflower Bridal a key destination for any modern bride across Wales, the South West and beyond.</p>
  <p>Amongst the pink velvet sofas, plush furnishings and contemporary fittings, brides will discover rails of gowns, jumpsuits and two-pieces, expertly curated by myself. My passion to provide brides with a premium boutique experience whilst maintaining a sense of fun means you will also find hidden gems, such as fashion-forward patches and bespoke slogan t-shirts by King Sophie’s World, exclusively available to Waxflower Brides.</p>
  <h2>Why call the shop Waxflower Bridal?</h2>
  <p>Why ‘Waxflower Bridal'? Well, the Waxflower is a beautiful small flower (perfect as a bridal bouquet filler!) which in the language of flowers means 'everlasting love'. I thought it would be a very fitting name for a boutique assisting brides in celebrating the everlasting love they have found.</p>
