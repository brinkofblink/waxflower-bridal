  <h2>A little bit about me…</h2>
  <p>Everyone calls me Kathy. I absolutely love everything bridal and fashion. I’ve been lucky enough to have worked in the luxury bridal industry for 10 years, being a luxury bridal stylist and becoming a manager of a well-known luxury bridal boutique in the UK. I have also been lucky enough to have studied at the prestigious London College of Fashion for 4 years studying footwear design and development at Cordwainers. I am such a sucker for a good pair of shoes!</p>
  <p>I have a beautiful daughter called Hattie who was born on May 25th 2017 (14 months now). I want to show her that you can do anything you want in life as long as you put your mind to it, you have to follow your dreams like I am doing now, opening my very own boutique.</p>

    <h2>The boutique</h2>
    <p>I feel so lucky to be able to open my own luxury bridal boutique, Waxflower Bridal, in Chepstow, South Wales. Chepstow is such beautiful historic town which is in such a great location for the Welsh brides and for the South West brides as it is only 30 minutes away from Bristol and 45 minutes from Bath etc.</p>

  <div><h2>Why is it called ‘Waxflower Bridal’?</h2>
  <p>‘Waxflower’ in the language of flowers means ‘everlasting love’ which I thought would be appropriate for the boutique. I hope you think so too!?</p>

  <div><h2>British design</h2>
  <p>Waxflower Bridal only stocks the best of British bridal designers as I want to support the British bridal industry and to show that British bridal design is cool, chic, modern, stylish and timeless. The quality in the craftsmanship, cut and luxurious fabric used is second to none. You just can’t beat it! The pieces are also handmade in the UK. Waxflower bridal caters designs and tastes for every kind of bride that will walk through the door. You express yourself as an individual through clothing and brides should be able to have this choice through bridal design, which from having 10 years experience, we have catered for with the designs that we have chosen to stock </p>
  <p>The best thing about my job is getting to know every one of my brides. I absolutely love the amazing journey I go through with them. It is always a bonus in making life-long friends with my brides! What can I say… I just love my job</p>
